# Language Learning with Movie Subtitles

## Description
This project is designed to assist individuals in learning a new language using movie subtitles. Through this project, users can view movie subtitles in both languages and practice effectively. In this project, I will retrieve data from the API that I have created.

## Features

### Must-have Features

- **Three Different Pages:** The application includes three main pages - the home page, movies page, and movie-subtitle page. Client-side routing is implemented, allowing users to seamlessly navigate between these pages.

- **Movies Page:** Users can access a list of movies on this page. They have the option to remove/delete movies from the list or access the subtitles of their preferred movie.

- **Movie-Subtitle Page:** Upon entering this page, users will find a list of movie subtitles. It includes some toggles and buttons, providing users the ability to bookmark subtitles, toggle subtitle visibilities, or delete them as needed.

- **Subtitle Search:** Users can search for a specific word or expression on the movie-subtitle page and retrieve the relevant subtitle.

- **Pagination:** Subtitles are paginated for better organization and user experience.

### Nice-to-have Features

- **Styling and Responsive Design:** The project includes visually appealing styling and ensures a responsive design for a seamless experience across different devices.

- **A new page called Favorites to list and interact with all favorited subtitles.**

- **Homepage to create a new movie entry:** This page is to call back end to find subtitles for both languages and persist them in the data storage.

This feature enhances the user's ability to manage their favorite subtitles effectively.
